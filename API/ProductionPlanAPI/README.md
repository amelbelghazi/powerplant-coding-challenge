## Requirement for the API
The project is developed using .NET 6.0 having visual studio alreay installed, you would have all the requirement if not you can download [.NET 6.0 SDK and Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60) or install it directly using the Visual Studio Installer.

## Building the API

Build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with [the .NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Then run
these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample:

```console
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

These will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run
the project respectively.
